# Multilingual Number Guessing Game 🎮

This project showcases a **Number Guessing Game** implemented in multiple programming languages: **Java**, **C#**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Node.js**. The goal is to demonstrate how to make **HTTP requests** across different programming languages by using the public **Numbers API** (`http://numbersapi.com/random/trivia`) to fetch random trivia about numbers.

## How to Run the Game

### 1. **Java** ☕
To run the Java version of the game:
1. Ensure **Java 8+** is installed.
2. Navigate to the `Java` folder.
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac Program.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Program
   ```

### 2. **C#** 💻
To run the C# version of the game:
1. Ensure **.NET Core 3.1+** is installed.
2. Navigate to the `CSharp` folder.
3. Build and run the program:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### 3. **C++** 💾
To run the C++ version of the game:
1. Ensure a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) is installed.
2. Navigate to the `C++` folder.
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o C++ Program.cpp
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./Program
   ```

### 4. **Python** 🐍
To run the Python version of the game:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed.
2. Navigate to the `Python` folder.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python program.py
   ```

### 5. **Node.js** 🌐
To run the Node.js version of the game:
1. Ensure **Node.js** is installed.
2. Navigate to the `Node.js` folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   node program.js
   ```

## Using the Numbers API

This game uses the **Numbers API** (`http://numbersapi.com/random/trivia`) to fetch random trivia about numbers. It makes **simple HTTP requests** to the API and uses the returned trivia to present to the user. The game does not implement a complex API but leverages this public API for random number facts.

### API Endpoint:
- **GET `/random/trivia`** – Returns random trivia about a number.

## Contributions in Additional Languages

We **highly encourage** contributions in other languages! 🌍 This is a great way to expand the project and make it accessible to a global audience. When contributing, **please ensure consistency in variable and file naming** across languages. Try to maintain the same **naming conventions** in each language, so the code remains clear and easy to understand for all developers.

For example:
- Use **consistent file and variable names** across languages (e.g., `numberGuessingGame` in JavaScript should be the same in Python and C++).
- Stick to the **correct naming convention** for each language (e.g., **camelCase** in JavaScript, **PascalCase** in C#, etc.).

This will help keep the project maintainable and scalable.
